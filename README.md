# - My Academic Works -

This repository showcases academic projects and exercises from various computer science disciplines from my time at the **Federal University of Uberlandia**. Below is a brief overview of each subject:

---

>## Applied Software Architecture
>Explores the design and structure of software systems, focusing on architectural patterns and best practices for scalable and maintainable applications.


>## Computer Graphics
>Involves the development of graphical applications, including a project inspired by the rhythm game Beat Saber, emphasizing real-time rendering and interactive graphics.

>## Data Bases
>Covers the fundamentals of database systems, including design, querying, and management of relational and non-relational databases.


>## Data Structures
>Focuses on the implementation and application of fundamental data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues, essential for efficient algorithm design.

>## Distributed Systems
>Studies the design and implementation of systems that run on multiple computers, addressing challenges like concurrency, fault tolerance, and scalability.

>## Elements of Computational Systems
>Introduces the basic components of computational systems, including hardware, software, and the interaction between them.

>## Introduction to Programming
>Provides foundational knowledge in programming, covering basic concepts, syntax, and problem-solving techniques.

>## Logic Programming
>Explores programming paradigms based on formal logic, focusing on declarative problem-solving and symbolic reasoning.

>## Machine Learning
>Delves into algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to learn from and make predictions on data.

>## Object-Oriented Programming
>Emphasizes the design and implementation of software using objects and classes, promoting modularity and reuse.

>## Procedural Programming
>Focuses on programming techniques that follow a sequence of steps or procedures, emphasizing control flow and function usage.

>## Real-Time Computing Systems
>Studies systems that must respond to inputs within strict timing constraints, crucial for applications like embedded systems and robotics.

>## Scripting Programming
>Covers the use of scripting languages for automating tasks, processing data, and integrating systems.

>## Web Technology
>Explores the development of web applications, including frontend and backend technologies, and the principles of web architecture.
